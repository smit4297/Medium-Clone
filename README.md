Certainly! I'll create a README.md file for your project based on the information you've provided. This README will include setup instructions for both the backend and frontend components of your project.

```

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following content:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=YOUR_POSTGRES-DB-URL
   ```

3. Ensure you have a `wrangler.toml` file with the following content:
   ```toml
   name = "backend"
   compatibility_date = "2023-12-01"
   [vars]
   DATABASE_URL=prisma-accelerate-url
   JWT_SECRET = YOUR_JWT_SECRET
   ```

4. Install dependencies (assuming you're using npm):
   ```
   npm install
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the frontend directory with the following content:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://avnadmin:AVNS_VFCeK5nC-mZFj79NsKh@pg-76c4766-code-b382.i.aivencloud.com:24605/defaultdb?sslmode=require"
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- The backend uses Cloudflare Workers (as indicated by the wrangler.toml file).
- The frontend appears to be using Prisma for database access.
- Make sure to keep your `.env` files secure and do not commit them to version control.

## Security Warning

The provided configuration files contain sensitive information such as database URLs and API keys. In a production environment, ensure these are kept secure and not exposed in public repositories.
